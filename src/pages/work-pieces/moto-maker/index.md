At Motorola, I led the UX Engineering team within their Customer Experience Design group. One of our primary responsibilities was bridging the gap between design and development by creating high-fidelity prototypes of complex products such as Moto Maker, the award-winning phone customization platform. These prototypes enabled rapid and more useful user testing feedback, reduced documentation work for design, and allowed our off-site development team to more accurately create the design teamâ€™s intent.
