Created high-fidelity prototypes using React for web and mobile apps, including Moto Maker, the award-winning phone customization platform, and Moto Display, the first always-on Android lock screen. This enabled rapid and more useful user testing feedback, reduced documentation work for design, and allowed our off-site engineering team to more accurately create the design teamâ€™s intent.
