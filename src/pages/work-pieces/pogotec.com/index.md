PogoTec is a consumer electronics startup focusing on wearable technology. As Director of Digital Design & Development, I inherited disjointed corporate and product sites that were being maintained by agencies. An in-house team was built and launched a unified corporate, product, and eCommerce site. The new site had unified branding, a consistent tone of voice, and reduced loading times. By bringing the team in house, the young startup saved $400k in the first year.
