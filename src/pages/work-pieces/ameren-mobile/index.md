Ameren, a major regional utility, wanted an affordable mobile product for their customers that could be easily maintained by their in-house IT team. I led the front end team to deliver a hybrid mobile app (web, iOS, and Android) written in web technologies and trained the IT team members to own the product post-launch. The solution achieved 95% code sharing between platforms.
