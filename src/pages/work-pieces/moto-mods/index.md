As Motorola prepared to introduce the Moto Z and Moto Mods, they needed a product page that clearly explained to customers how this new phone platform worked. Working closely with design and product management, my team created a product page with a hero element that allowed visitors to snap together different combinations of Moto Z phones and Moto Mods. At launch, the conversion rate for users who interacted with this element outpaced users who did not.
