  <h4>Lead UX Engineer</h4>

  <p>I managed a team consisting of myself and two UX Engineers. My team was responsible for all high-fidelity (web and mobile app) prototyping, complex web A/B tests, rapid development of new web functionality, and being the liaison between design and development teams.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Created high-fidelity prototypes using React for web and mobile apps, including Moto Maker,
      the award-winning phone customization platform, and Moto Display, the first always-on Android
      lock screen. This enabled quicker and more useful user testing feedback, reduced documentation
      work for design, and allowed our off-site engineering team to more accurately create the
      design
      team’s intent.
    </li>
    <li>Created A/B testing process that brought together Design, Product Management, and IT teams

    </li>
    <li>Created complex A/B tests with JavaScript that resulted in significant business improvements
      including: cancelling a six-figure product rendering improvement project would not have
      increased conversions, increasing revenue by abandoning full-browser-height content sections,
      increasing revenue 15% by reordering product page content sections, and doubling revenue by
      using a different art direction for photography.
    </li>
    <li>Designed, developed, and launched a short-term compare products page that increased
      conversions by 50% for all sessions that visited it.
    </li>
    <li>Recreated 360º product viewers to increase their loading time by 500%.</li>
    <li>Revamped process for creating tens of thousands of product renders for Moto Maker resulting
      in
      higher fidelity, faster creation, 80% reduction in final web file size, and lower production
      costs. I analyzed issues with previous process and coordinated with Industrial Design, Product
      Management, and IT to create the new solution.
    </li>
    <li>Created Kanban-based process for all UX team projects resulting easier tracking of progress
      and improved ability to handle ever-changing requirements.
    </li>
